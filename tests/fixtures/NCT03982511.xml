    <brief_summary>
        <textblock>
            Childhood obesity is a formidable public health issue in the United States, disproportionately affecting
            children from lower socioeconomic status households. Onset of obesity predicts cardiometabolic risks and
            other health problems in adolescence and into adulthood; thus, effective and early prevention is critical.
            Healthy parenting may play a pivotal role in preventing early childhood obesity. Warm, responsive, and
            consistent parenting is associated with the development of child self-regulation as well as healthy eating
            and physical activity practices, and thus may be protective against obesity risk. Targeting the parent-child
            relationship may be especially important when facilitating behavior change in parents who have ongoing
            stressors (e.g., low-income families). The proposed study aims to test an adaptation of Parent-Child
            Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an innovative parent management program that improves the parent-child
            relationship and enhances general parenting skills through the use of therapeutic in vivo coaching. Our
            adapted version, PCIT-Health, is a selective-prevention intervention that includes content specific to
            improving parent-child interactions and parenting in obesity-salient contexts, such as mealtime and child
            screen time. This project will elucidate novel approaches to, and novel targets of, early childhood obesity
            prevention and will provide data critical to test PCIT-Health in a large-scale randomized controlled trial.
            Parent-child dyads will be randomly assigned to PCIT-Health or a waitlist control in order to accomplish the
            following aims: AIM 1: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of the PCIT-Health delivery and
            assessment methods in low-income parents of overweight young children ages 3 to 6 years. AIM 2: To test the
            preliminary efficacy and estimate the effect size of PCIT-Health on changes in child BMI z-score (primary
            outcome) from baseline to (1) intervention completion and (2) 6-month post-intervention. AIM 3: To explore
            the effect of PCIT-Health on the following secondary outcomes: (1) parent-child relationship quality, (2)
            parent behavior management skills, (3) child self-regulation, (4) child eating behaviors, (5) child physical
            activity, and (6) child screen media use.

            Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-IV (DPICS-IV) will be used. The DPICS provides a reliable
            measure of parent-child relationship quality (e.g., parents' child-centered skills, parent and child
            positive and negative physical and verbal interactions) and parent behavior management skills (e.g., use of
            contingent reinforcement, effective discipline, child compliance).

            PCIT-Health (also known as Parents Active in Their Children's Health; PATCH) is an adaptation of
            Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. PCIT-Health targets (1) the parent-child relationship and (2) parenting
            efficacy both in general contexts (child play time and clean up time) and specifically in the context of
            obesity risk-related behaviors (child feeding, family mealtime, and child screen time).
