      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a second generation
      EndoBarrier Liner compared to a study diet to treat Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes.

      This is a randomized, controlled study which will enroll approximately 70 Subjects with Type
      2 Diabetes. Randomization will be one to one with approximately 35 EndoBarrier device
      Subjects and approximately 35 study diet Subjects. Subjects randomized as diet Subjects will
      be offered the EndoBarrier device after 12 months on study at the investigator's discretion
      if treatment of the device subjects indicates adequate efficacy. This study will be conducted
      at three (3) investigational sites.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is:

        -  Assessment of the percent (%) of Subjects who achieve a ≥ 0.5% reduction in HbA1C at 24
           weeks or last visit from baseline between the two groups.

      Secondary endpoints are:

        -  Percent (%) of Subjects who achieve a HbA1C of 7.0% or lower at week 24 or last visit
           from baseline.

        -  Percent (%) of Subjects who have their diabetic medication(s) dosage decreased or
           discontinued at week 24 or last visit from baseline.

        -  Percent (%) of Subjects who achieve a decrease in post-prandial excursions as evidenced
           by challenge to a standardized meal tolerance test (MTT) at week 24 or last visit from
           baseline.

        -  Assessment of absolute weight loss (Kg) at week 24 or last visit from baseline.

        -  Percent (%) of Subjects who maintain a HbA1c lower than their baseline assessment at 12
           months.

        -  Compare physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) and quality
           adjusted life years (QALYs)via analysis of the SF-36v2 QOL.

      Utilization of the EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner in obese subjects with T2DM
      demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with clinically significant improvements in
      glycemic control and body weight when compared to a similar diet controlled group of
      subjects.
