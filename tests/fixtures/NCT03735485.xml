  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
      Facilitation (PNF) exercises and Shoulder Mobilization (SM) on pain, range of motion (ROM),
      functionality, and muscle strength in patients with Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS).
      Patients received 20 sessions (for 4 weeks) under the supervision of a physiotherapist.
      Patients were evaluated at baseline, at week two, at week four, and at week sixteen.

      Aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
      Facilitation (PNF) exercises and Shoulder Mobilization (SM) on pain, range of motion (ROM),
      functionality, and muscle strength in patients with Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS).
      Forty-four patients were divided into three groups as Group I: Conventional physiotherapy
      receiving group (control group; n=14), Group II: Conventional physiotherapy + PNF exercises
      receiving group (PNF group; n=15), and Group III: conventional physiotherapy + SM receiving
      group (SM group; n=15). Pain, ROM, muscle strength, and functionality were evaluated by using
      visual analog scale (VAS), goniometer, push-pull dynamometer, Constant-Murley score and The
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score respectively. Patients received 20
      sessions in total under supervision of a physiotherapist. Patients were evaluated at
      baseline, at week two, at week four, and at week sixteen.

    <intervention_model_description>There were three study groups: 1. The control group: Participants in this group received only conventional physiotherapy treatment. 2. The shoulder mobilization group: Participants in this group received conventional physiotherapy and shoulder joint mobilization techniques as treatment. The Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) group. Participants in this group received conventional physiotherapy and PNF exercises as treatment.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder pain: VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain scale of shoulder at week 2, 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was defined with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A 10-cm long horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) with marks 0 point (no pain) and 10 point (unbearable pain) was used for evaluating the pain severity. The patients were asked to mark the representing point of their pain levels. The values were recorded in cm. The pain severity was asked in three occasions as: at resting (VASr), during activity (VASa) and during night (VASn).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability of the shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score at week 2, 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score was used to evaluate the upper extremity physical function. DASH includes two modules as disability / symptom section and work section. The scores are ranged between 0-100. Higher scores indicate lower functionality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Function of the shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Constant-Murley score at week 2, 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to DASH, the Constant-Murley score was used to evaluate the functionality of the shoulder. Constant-Murley score is a 100-point scoring system and consisted of four sub-scores as pain (15 points), daily living activities (20 points), active range of motion (40 points), and muscle strength (25 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline active range of motion at week 2, 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>The active range of motion was assessed by using a universal goniometer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline muscle strength of shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, shoulder adduction, shoulder external rotation, and shoulder internal rotation at week 2, 4 and 16.</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle strength of shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, shoulder adduction, shoulder external rotation, and shoulder internal rotation were determined by using Baseline Push-Pull (New York, USA) dynamometer. The dynamometer was placed in a 90 degrees angle on the location and the patient was asked to contract in maximum for two seconds and then maintain this position for five seconds. Two assessments were performed, and average values were recorded. Pain was avoided during the measurements.</description>

    <intervention_name>Conventional Physiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>The conventional physiotherapy program consisted of electrotherapy and exercise approaches. The electrotherapy program consisted of infrared (for 15 minutes, from 70 cm distance), conventional Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in an encircled region (for 20 minutes; with 4 electrodes, 100 Hz, 100 msec), and therapeutic Ultrasound (for 3 minutes; 1 megahertz (MHz), power: 1,5 W/cmÂ²).
A physiotherapist supervised exercise program was performed following the electrotherapy program. Elastic resistive exercises were added at the week three. While, the first set of wand exercises and elastic resistive exercises was performed under supervision, two sets of the showed exercises were given as the home exercise program.</description>

    <description>In shoulder mobilization technique while the shoulder joint was placed in the traction, anterior, posterior, and inferior gliding and circumduction were applied to the humerus for 2-3 minutes. All mobilization applications were performed in painless range of motion (ROM) limits. The degree of traction and gliding were increased as the relaxing obtained in the tissues.</description>
